# paint

Looking to get some feedback/code review.

hit c to clear screen

hit spacebar to remove on screen buttons basically fullscreen mode

screen can be resize to max screen size for larger draw area

Line: draws a line between 2 points

Draw: draws as long as the mouse button is held down

Save: saves to same directory as program location and saves as test.txt

Load: loads test.txt doesnt do anything if file does not exist

color defaults to black unless you choose another color.
